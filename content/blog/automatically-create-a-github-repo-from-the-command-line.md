If you don't have `hub` installed, you should:

[Github's hub tool](https://hub.github.com/)

I use the `git` alias (instead of the default `hub`) and
I end up using `git create` almost every day.

## Easily Create Codesanboxes from Your New Repo

It becomes so easy to work on something locally, run `git create` then push,
then open the repo from [codesandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io) by
simply appending the username and repo after `http://codesandbox.io/s/github/`

For example:

`http://codesandbox.io/s/github/username/repo`
`http://codesandbox.io/s/github/johnlindquist/fp-lessons`
