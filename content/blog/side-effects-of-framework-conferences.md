Conference organizers: I love you all and I know how difficult your jobs are.
This is not a critique of anything you do, so please know I have nothing but respect
for the effort you put into each of your conferences.

## About My Conference Experience

I've been to many conferences over the past decade across a wide span of tech and languages.
All the big ones (I/O, Build, whatever) to many tiny ones (most recently MagnoliaJS in Jackson, Mississippi).
I've attended as an attendee, speaker, and even dev advocate sitting behind a booth. I have "conference friends"
which is essentially a funny group of people with a billion airline miles traveling the world year-round for conferences.
