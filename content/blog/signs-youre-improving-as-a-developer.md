I've met many developers who don't realize how much they're skills have improved over the years. I thought I'd make a list to help you recognize your own development:

## 1. Cringing at Your Old Code

The path to expertise is paved with good intentions and poor execution. We tried our best, we shipped software, and we moved on.

## 2. Listening to Opposing Ideas

After awhile in the field, you'll start to realize that solutions come from everywhere. Especially when someone is challenging your own personal convictions around code.

It can be really hard to swallow our own pride when we've worked tirelessly on a solution then have someone else come in and tear it apart.

## 3. Asking Questions

The more you learn, the more you realize you don't know. This can easily result in a cycle of feeling dumber and dumber, especially when researching a new topic.
