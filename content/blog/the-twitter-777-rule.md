I kept a hard rule of following exactly 777 people on twitter.
This forces me to unfollow someone whenever I want to follow someone new.

Is it working out for me? I can't really tell, but I do feel like my twitter timeline is improving 1% every time I do it.
And living the "improve your life 1% at a time" is good enough for me.
