I don't know anymore. I thought that programming was writing some code and handing it over to a computer to execute.

Now it seems like we weave together services and sites automatically appear through some magical internet portal.

Take this example:

1. Drag n' drop/commit a picture to Github
2. This triggers a Netlify build of your project
3. Gatsby processes the images and resizes and queries the images it needs
4. A static site is deployed all optimized for desktop and mobile

I mean, what even is that? That's not the programming I grew up with.

You know what though? I'll take it!
