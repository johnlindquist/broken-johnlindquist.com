## Frontend Development

### Vue/React/Angular

I spent about 50% of my time with Vue, 50% with React, and ~0% with Angular.
I still have no idea which one I like the most, but if you tell me a scenario, I have
a good feeling towards which I would use.

I _really_ love [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org) and [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/) and all the stacks
of tools that solve the real problems of building dynamic websites.

### Hyperapp/Calmm/Svelte

If I were to write a "framework", I would write [Hyperapp](https://github.com/hyperapp/hyperapp).
Expect a course on hyperapp on [egghead.io](https://egghead.io) in January ðŸ˜‡

I think [Calmm](https://github.com/calmm-js/documentation/blob/master/introduction-to-calmm.md)
is a stack of tools that many people are looking for, but they don't know it exists.
Observables inside of JSX, lenses, atoms, etc, it's really quite impressive, but
no one has heard of it.

I think [Svelte](https://svelte.technology/) is a wonderful solution for those
looking for a template-based approach. I also think [Sapper](https://github.com/sveltejs/sapper)
should have a big impact in 2018.

### RxJS/Most

I love RxJS because it's bringing Observables to the mainstream. I love [Most]()
because of their new composable API. The code in [this demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/7o2rx4n4kx)
is just beautiful.

## FP

2017 was the year that Functional Programming really _clicked_ for me. It was
also the year where I realized how easy it is to push FP too far. I've found
a happy balance between "point-free all the things" and "code normal" and I'm
a bit more at peace and more confident authoring code than I've been in a while.

### Partial.Lenses

I fell in love with lenses in 2017, especially the library [partial.lenses](https://github.com/calmm-js/partial.lenses).
Conquering huge objects with tiny composable
functions, yum! Lenses are one of those concepts that don't really seem like
they have much of a payoff when you just start out with them and you don't
fully realize their value until your data/state gets more complicated. I hope
to be able to teach that well in 2018.

### Codesandbox

[Ives](https://twitter.com/CompuIves) is _killin' it_ with [Codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/). He's even
been kind enough to support a couple of my feature requests and we're proud
supporters from egghead.io. I can't wait to see where he takes the product.
I know I love hosting my demos with them.

### VS Code

The thing I love the most about VS Code is the monthly release cycle of
great new features. I find myself missing a lot of features from WebStorm, but
I also tend to edit so many tiny one-off files that VS Code has been my go to.
VS Code is also really easy to make look so nice for videos/presentions/workshops
that it's hard to justify opening WebStorm even though I know WebStorm is "better".
Gah, I'm so torn over this one. I love them both so much. I need a bigger heart.

### Gatsbyjs

[Gatsbyjs](gatsbyjs.org) seems like the perfect answer to gitbook. Where gitbook
locks you into a specific pattern with markdown files, Gatsbyjs allows you
to use markdown, but then write JS to render (using React) when you need to.
I'm looking forward to spending a lot of time with Gatsbyjs in 2018 and I'm
super excited for their v2 release.

### Docker

Docker is one of those things I love, but don't have nearly enough practical
experience with. Configure once, forget it, but then when it's time to upgrade
it feels like learning it for the first time all over again.

### Poi and Parcel

I love the "zero configuration" movement. [Poi](https://poi.js.org/#/) and [Parcel](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel)
are both incredible and I can't thank the authors enough for sharing them.

### Zeit

I love everything [zeit.co](https://zeit.co/) has put out this year: `now`, `hyper`,
`next.js`, `micro`, they're like a year-round Santa handing out presents. I
just wish their hosting didn't experience so much down time. I'm hoping they
get it all sorted in 2018 (ironically, their sites are down as I'm writing this).

## Office

### Keyboard

I'm a keyboard nut (I have quite the collection) and I just have to say that
I'm completely blown away by the [Keyboard.io](http://keyboard.io). It deserves
a full review of its own.

I recently received the [Ultimate Hacking Keyboard](http://uhk.io), but I
haven't had any time to put it through its paces. I'm _really_ excited about
the prospect of the trackball/pointer add-ons, but those don't come out until
later on in 2018.

### Mouse

I have the [Logitech G900](http://amzn.to/2Cg4rzB). Great mouse. Long battery
life. I've dabbled in trackballs, but I just have to have the precision of
mouse for my video editing and selecting code.

### Monitor

I'm using the [AOC Agon](http://amzn.to/2Cg4rzB) monitor. I've come
to love higher refresh rates on screens. I never thought that I'd care, but it's
super noticeable to me now even for simple things like dragging windows around.

### Laptop

I'm on the latest 13" macbook pro. I've found 13" is really the sweet spot
for me between portability and size. Run most things in full-screen and swipe
between spaces. I don't hate the keyboard as much as many people do, at least
it has proper n-key rollover for my weird "chording" I have set up in karabiner.

Windows keeps calling me back and WSL keeps getting better and better, but I'd
really need autohotkey to catch up to karabiner to take it seriously.

### Phone

I'm on an iPhone X. I kinda wish I was on the iPhone 8 because the face ID
really bugs me. My bigger wish is that iMessage worked cross-platform because
then android phones would actually be an option, but alas, Apple stuff is fine.

### Keyboard/Mouse Switches

I've got a beefy PC for gaming. I use [this](http://amzn.to/2Cg4rzB) for monitor
switching and [this](http://amzn.to/2CfC073) for USB switching. So I'm only
two button clicks from switching between work and games ðŸ˜†. I couldn't find a
good monitor switch that also had USB 3.0, so I keep them separate.

### Headphones/Speakers/Mic/Etc

I haven't changed many of my peripherals in 2017, so not really worth talking
about.

## Gaming

### Nintendo Switch

Zelda blew me away. Mario brought endless joy. I love the indie games and
even bought Rocket League again. I should really make more time to play.

### PC

I haven't played Overwatch since the beginning of the year. It's always on the
back of my mind, but never quite make it a priority. I put a couple dozen hours
into Warframe and have quite enjoyed it, but didn't really get too far.

Loved playing [Ultimate Chicken Horse](http://store.steampowered.com/app/386940/Ultimate_Chicken_Horse/)
with my boys on Steam. [Stick Fight](http://store.steampowered.com/app/674940/Stick_Fight_The_Game/)
was a blast for a night.

### VR

A lot of the VR experiences have made me queezy, so I've never been able to
spend any significant amount of time playing. The most fun I had was playing
[I Expect You to Die](https://iexpectyoutodie.schellgames.com/).

## Books

First, I hate spoilers, so I'm just going to say that I loved these books
and leave you to read up on it however much you want:

- [The Rook](http://amzn.to/2C6nNKN)
- [Unsouled](http://amzn.to/2C6otjj) (the whole Cradle series is great so far)

Read a few other random books, but I'm just realizing that I need to read more.

# The One Thing I Hated

"Michael Vey 7: The Final Spark" was an atrocity. I've written [one book review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2123844630?book_show_action=false)
in my life and it was to express how poor I thought this book was.
